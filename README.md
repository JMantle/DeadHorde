Simple top-down shooter made for my computer science A level course work, expanded for my entertainment. Made in Lua using Defold.

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. leaderboard does not work, I have been attempting to improve the leaderboard to run on other devices and in doing so, I broke them completely
2. The sprites dont look as smooth as they can as I made them myself and the images are a bit scuffed
3. the code is not properly commented and cleaned, I did this on a different file specifically made to hand in for coursework
